t3lib_div::devLog()

Using the logging method
To log something simply call t3lib_div::devLog(). This method takes the following parameters:

$msg 
	The message that you want to write to the log
$extKey	
	The key of the extension writing to the log
$severity
	Indication of the severity of the message. The following values are expected:
	-1 for ok status
	0 for a purely informational message
	1 for a notice
	2 for a warning
	3 for a (fatal) error
	This parameter is optional and defaults to 0.
$dataVar
	This is an array that can contain any data you wish and that you find useful for information or debugging purposes. 
	It is serialised before being stored in the database. In the backend module it is unserialised and displayed as with t3lib_div::debug().
	This parameter is optional and defaults to false.
	If something else than an array is passed to this parameter, it will be stripped and replaced by an error message (see screenshot below).

	
t3lib_div::devLog($msg, $this->extKey, $severity(-1 0 1 2 3), array() $dataVar);
